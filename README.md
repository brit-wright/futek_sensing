# futek_sensing

This repository is for interfacing with the Futek MBA500 (Thrust/Torque Biaxial Sensor) over USB220. This repository was specifically developed to characterize the thrust and torque of a ds-51-axi hds thruster but this code is suitable for general sensing applications. All code is written in Python

# useful libraries
I recommend having the following Python modules installed: pyserial, datetime, csv, time, statistics. These allow for serial communication with the sensor, timed tests, storing results as .csv and computing standard deviation (if needed).
